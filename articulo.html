                    <h3>The 10 Best Cafés of Antalya</h3>
                    <p>
                        Like we mentioned in our Istanbul review, Turkey (read more about their coffee culture here) is the place where you can get some of the best coffee in the world. This southern city in Turkey is a great summer tourist place. With its Azure blue sea, golden beaches and world famous Turkish hospitality make this city a tourist paradise.
        
        Whatever you are doing while here, and there is a lot to do (driving quads, jeep safari, aqua parks), you will need to regain all of that spent energy. There are many ancient landmarks like Termessos or Kalcici, that takes time and energy to explore. Aqua parks are so much fun, but will make you feel exhausted afterwards.
        
        Check out the must see landmarks of Antalya by visiting this site!
        
        If you prefer being on the beaches, you will want to cool off with one ice coffee in a nearby café. Whichever activity you choose to do, most important thing is to have fun while doing it.
        
        Since there is so much to do here, in this article, we will help you find some excellent cafés for you to choose which suits you best. Then just sit down, have a good time and enjoy the coffee.
